## Structure

AlumXi is led by a 9 person executive board. The executive board is
elected by the greater AlumXi membership in electronic elections that
are held every 2 years. After the wider election, the exectutive board
holds a board-only internal election for officer positions. More
details are in our bylaws.

Elections are announced via email. Contact rawhide@alumxi.com if you
want to check that your address on file is up-to-date. Every election
cycle we solicit nominations for board members. All members in good
standing are welcome to run!

## Meetings

Every year there is at least one Annual Meeting for all members of
AlumXi. The meetings are a mix of updates, voting and discussion. We
highly encourage all members to attend, either in-person or via
teleconference. Annual Meetings are announced via our mailing lists.

The executive board also meets regularly, typically every 2-4
weeks. Any member is welcome to sit in on executive board meetings,
but non-board members cannot vote. The executive board meeting dates
are announced in the minutes, which are sent to minutes@alumxi.com. If
you want to join this list to see the minutes, send a request to
president@alumxi.com.

# Volunteering

There are many opportunities to volunteer!

## Events

In addition to the Annual Meeting, we have a number of social events
every year such as Initiation, The CROCK, coffee hours and
reunions. Most events are family-friendly, and many are free. To see
the latest, check out our [events page](../../events/current).

#### 2020-2-26 Story Hour v2.2

By popular demand, our first event of 2021 will be another Story Hour at 9:22ET on Feb. 26. We'll be kicking off the event with a quick post-election "Meet the Board" event, plus a special announcement. Immediately following will be 2-3 icebreaker stories to get everyone warmed up for sharing their own. We hear that a few new peldges may even be joining us! Check your email for the zoom link.

NOTE: the first 45 minutes of this event strives to be family friendly. The second half will open up to allow less delicate language and content.

The crock is going virtual! Join us for the first online edition of our beloved annual comic rock opera on Thursday, October 29, 2020 at 9:22 PM ET. It'll either be so good or so bad that you'll laugh and you'll cry.

NOTE: Event link was emailed out to drool on 10/23. We will not be posting it online, to avoid unwanted Zoom gremlins. Send us a message if you can't find it!

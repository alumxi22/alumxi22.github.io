Note that AlumXi is a 501(c)7 not-for-profit and contributions are
**not** tax-deductible. If that is a significant concern, you can [donate to certain MIT funds](#giving-to-mit) instead.

## Dues

Phi Inc are \$22.22 for 2021 onwards. They can be paid using any of the options below.

## How to Donate to alumxi

We are running our first 22nd annual [capital

## Other ways to donate

The form above is the easiest way to donate and it has low fees, but there are other options:

### PayPal

You can donate via Paypal using the "Donate" button below. This can be a one-time or monthly donation. You get to pick the amount of your donation. May we suggest $22.22 or $222.22? Please keep in mind that PayPal does charge a fee, so for large donations we would advise you to send money via ACH or mail as described below.

# Giving to MIT

Giving money to MIT helps maintain MIT’s educational excellence and assists the current generation of MIT students to cope with eye-popping cost of an MIT education.

There are two funds of particular interest to MIT alumni of TEP:

# The FredFund

Fred Fenning was a beloved member of TEP who died after his airplane experienced a mechanical failure. Fred donated his time generously to the house after graduating and his technical abilities and warm-hearted nature were an inspiration to generations of TEPs.

The FredFund is an endowed scholarship at MIT that was set up by Fred’s parents after his death. The current principal in the FredFund is `$513,082` (as of Dec 2013) and it has paid out `$284,501` in scholarship funds since its inception in 1998.

Help support scholarships for undergraduates by directing your MIT gift to the FredFund.

# The IRDF

The IRDF (Independent Residence Development Fund) provides a pool of money that is used to subsidize loans to Independent Living Groups. The loans are generally used for capital improvement programs.

Xi chapter has made use of IRDF funds for a number of projects, including:

- Fire alarm systems
- Kitchen ventilation
- Double-pane windows

The IRDF provides loans at below-market rates and donations from alumni help make up the difference. Help support much-needed infrastructure improvements at MIT’s ILGs by directing your MIT gift to the IRDF.

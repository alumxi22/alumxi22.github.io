title: "Donate to Alumxi"
---

**AlumXi needs your help!** We are here to make sure that Tep endures,
helping future Teply MIT students find a place they can make their own,
just as we all did. To do that, we need your financial support.

Note that AlumXi is a 501(c)7 not-for-profit and contributions are
**not** tax-deductible. If that is a significant concern, you can [donate to certain MIT funds](#giving-to-mit) instead.

## How much to give?

If at all possible, we encourage setting up a **recurring, monthly donation**.
Whatever amount works for you is welcome,
but if you're looking for some guidelines,
we've prepared a handy chart below.
The chart shows several donation tiers -- pick the one best for you!
**If all the alumxi alumni gave at the "alumxi advocate tier", we would meet our fundraising goal!**

| Tier                                                                               | Recommended amount                       | In ten years, the interest on your donations will fund... |

## Dues

Alumxi annual dues are **\$22 per year**.
If you setup a monthly donation, that money counts towards your annual dues.
If you do not have a monthly donation, then you must contribute at least \$22 to be considered a member in good standing
and hence eligible to vote in elections.

# Giving to MIT

Giving money to MIT helps maintain MIT’s educational excellence and assists the current generation of MIT students to cope with eye-popping cost of an MIT education.

There are two funds of particular interest to MIT alumni of TEP:

# The FredFund

Fred Fenning was a beloved member of TEP who died after his airplane experienced a mechanical failure. Fred donated his time generously to the house after graduating and his technical abilities and warm-hearted nature were an inspiration to generations of TEPs.

The FredFund is an endowed scholarship at MIT that was set up by Fred’s parents after his death. The current principal in the FredFund is `$513,082` (as of Dec 2013) and it has paid out `$284,501` in scholarship funds since its inception in 1998.

Help support scholarships for undergraduates by directing your MIT gift to the FredFund.

# The IRDF

The IRDF (Independent Residence Development Fund) provides a pool of money that is used to subsidize loans to Independent Living Groups. The loans are generally used for capital improvement programs.

Xi chapter has made use of IRDF funds for a number of projects, including:

- Fire alarm systems
- Kitchen ventilation
- Double-pane windows

The IRDF provides loans at below-market rates and donations from alumni help make up the difference. Help support much-needed infrastructure improvements at MIT’s ILGs by directing your MIT gift to the IRDF.

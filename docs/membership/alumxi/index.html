        <p>All alumni of TEP Xi Chapter or Xi Fellowship are elligible to become

<h2 id="joining-alumxi">Joining AlumXi<a href="#joining-alumxi" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>To join AlumXi, all you have to do is be a Xi alum in good standing (see
above) and <a href="../giving/alumxi/#dues">pay your annual $22.22 dues</a>.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure<a href="#structure" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>AlumXi is led by a 9 person executive board. The executive board is
elected by the greater AlumXi membership in electronic elections that
are held every 2 years. After the wider election, the exectutive board
holds a board-only internal election for officer positions. More
details are in our bylaws.</p>
<p>Elections are announced via email. Contact <a href="mailto:rawhide@alumxi.com">rawhide@alumxi.com</a> if you
want to check that your address on file is up-to-date. Every election
cycle we solicit nominations for board members. All members in good
standing are welcome to run!</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings<a href="#meetings" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Every year there is at least one Annual Meeting for all members of
AlumXi. The meetings are a mix of updates, voting and discussion. We
highly encourage all members to attend, either in-person or via
teleconference. Annual Meetings are announced via our mailing lists.</p>
<p>The executive board also meets regularly, typically every 2-4
weeks. Any member is welcome to sit in on executive board meetings,
but non-board members cannot vote. The executive board meeting dates
are announced in the minutes, which are sent to <a href="mailto:minutes@alumxi.com">minutes@alumxi.com</a>. If
you want to join this list to see the minutes, send a request to
<a href="mailto:president@alumxi.com">president@alumxi.com</a>.</p>
<h1 id="volunteering">Volunteering<a href="#volunteering" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>There are many opportunities to volunteer!</p>
<h2 id="events">Events<a href="#events" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In addition to the Annual Meeting, we have a number of social events
every year such as Initiation, The CROCK, coffee hours and
reunions. Most events are family-friendly, and many are free. To see
the latest, check out our <a href="../../events/current">events page</a>.</p>

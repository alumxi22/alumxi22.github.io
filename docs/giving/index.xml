      <description>AlumXi needs your help! We are here to make sure that Tep endures, helping future Teply MIT students find a place they can make their own, just as we all did. To do that, we need your financial support.
Note that AlumXi is a 501(c)7 not-for-profit and contributions are not tax-deductible. If that is a significant concern, you can donate to certain MIT funds instead.
How much to give? If at all possible, we encourage setting up a recurring, monthly donation.</description>
